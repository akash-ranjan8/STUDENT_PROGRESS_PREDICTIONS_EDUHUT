# STUDENT_PROGRESS_PREDICTIONS_EDUHUT
Basically in this model i had taken 4 features 
1.Watched Time(Total)
2.No. of Courses done
3.Marks scored(Out Of 100)
By using these features I had predicted whether student is doing good or not.
I had used SVM kernel(Linear) to predict the output 0 or 1
0 defines as student needs improvement 
1 defines as student doing good work
I had prepared my own dataset where if watched time is equal or above 5 hrs ,minimum courses done is 1 and marks scored is 80 or above then i give output as 1 otherwise 0.
